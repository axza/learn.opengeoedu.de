Small-scale land use monitoring requires tools, models, algorithams, easy-to-understand geovisualisations in participation of divese actors at all decision-making levels.

Therefore, the spatial data and geostatistical information are having particular importance and should be more accurate, up-to-date and available free of charge.

**Fig: Topics of monitor by flowing scale and time**


The practical exercises aims to analyse **Available Open Date in combination with Basic Geoinformation including Temporal dimention**. The major milestons are:
1. Fundamental of data management,
2. Spatial Analysis und
3. Interactive Application.

The practical exercises section will introduce relevant topics of the thematic spatial analysis step by step.

- **Data sources** of Landuse, Building, Transport Network and Land covers
- **Land uses**-, Transportation and Building purpose
- Describe with **Indikators (Charteristics or propertices)**
- Analysis of different **Spatial scale (Administrative levels, Transport)**
- Visualization results in the from of **Maps, Tables, Diagrams**
