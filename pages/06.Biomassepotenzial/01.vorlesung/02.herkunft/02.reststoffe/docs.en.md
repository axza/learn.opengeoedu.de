The group of biogenic residues and waste materials consists of a large number of individual biomasses which can be divided into five groups according to their origin (see table below).

**Table: Aggregation stages of biogenic residues and waste materials with examplatory individual biomasses. Source: based on Brosowski et al. 2016**

| Aggregation level | Single biomass (examples) |
|-|-|
| forestry and wood industry waste | forest waste wood, bark, sawmill by-products, wood shavings, black liquor, other industrial waste wood, waste wood |
| Agricultural by-products | Cereal straw, slurry and manure, beet leaves, rapeseed straw |
| Municipal waste | Bio-waste (brown bin), biogenic fraction in private household waste, green waste from private households, kitchen and canteen waste, market waste, commercial food leftovers, used cooking oil from municipal waste, sewage sludge |
| Industrial waste | Waste from the food, feed, biotechnology and fuel industries |
| Waste materials from other areas | Forage and wood-like biomass from landscape conservation (green areas, cemetery areas, heathland areas, orchards, vineyards, moorland areas, roadside areas, railway sidelines) |

<br>
Currently, about 60-80 % of the biogenic residues and waste materials produced annually in Germany are used materially, e.g. as animal feed or bedding, or energetically (Brosowski et al. 2015). 

!! What could be the 5 most important residual and waste materials in Germany (measured by the amount available)?
